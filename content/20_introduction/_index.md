# Introducing the easyTravel team

The easyTravel Corporation just started their journey to modernize and move to a bigger cloud infrastructure footprint with the goal of more agility and efficiency to optimize workloads, innovate faster, and deliver optimal user experiences. But, with the market downturn in travel bookings, the team must still modernize and do **more with less**.

EasyTravel’s flagship product is their customer facing website where customers can search and book travel. In establishing their modernization goals, the team identified these specific problem areas to address as part of their journey:

* **Lack answers for planning** – The easyTravel application has been built over time and is managed with a patchwork of different legacy and open source infrastructure monitoring tools. As the team is starting to plan their modernization migration strategy, they have no easy way to answer key questions needed for planning: What technologies do we have? What are the best candidates to move? What can’t be moved because of insufficient support? What are the dependencies to other applications and services?

* **Don’t understand application usage and requirements** – In addition to not fully understanding the blueprint for the existing application and infrastructure landscape, the team does not fully know how the end-user traffic patterns map to the resource consumption patterns of services as to properly answer: what will it cost to run in the cloud? What network traffic will there be between the services we migrate and those that have to stay in the current data center?

* **How to ensure Service Levels** – Given the business challenges of the slower market, the last thing IT needs to do is cause an outage or create performance issues as services are moving and being replaced with cloud services. Currently, there is no unified view across on-prem, cloud apps and infrastructure, so it’s hard to know how the application and underlying services are behaving during and post migration.

* **Too much time looking for root cause** – The team has quickly learned that building out more cloud infrastructure, where everything is virtualized and dynamic, causes interdependencies to go way up, adding more layers of complexity. The result is that different teams from Ops and Apps and even Biz must get involved to review multiple tools, dashboards and logs and that translates a lot of time and resources wasted on troubleshooting.
