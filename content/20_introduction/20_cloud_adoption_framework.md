We at easyTravel have embraced Azure proven guidance found within the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview) that is designed to help create and implement the business and technology strategies necessary to succeed in the cloud.

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides us with the best practices, documentation, and tools that cloud architects, IT professionals, and business decision makers need to successfully achieve short-term and long-term objectives.

By leveraging Dynatrace we see the value in each phase:

* **Pre-Migration (Planning)**: Automatically generate a blueprint of existing infrastructure, services and the application landscape thanks to Dynatrace Smartscape Technology. Dynatrace baselines existing on-premise applications, automatically detects all dependencies (internal as well as external) and calculates current resource consumption. Additionally Dynatrace allows for “virtual” monolith to microservice migration planning without code changes. This enables us to make smarter re-architecture and re-platforming decisions based on the existing on-premise workload.
* **In-Migration (Readiness & Adoption)**: Dynatrace monitors the progress of shifting workloads to the cloud. It helps us make better decisions on what to move when based on how tightly coupled services are and on the automatic baseline comparison between pre-migration and in-migration
* **Post-Migration (Manage)**: AI-supported baselining on the migrated services allows for validating the success of the migration project from a performance, resource and cost perspective. Live performance insights into the full stack allows us to dynamically scale and implement auto-mitigation strategies!

With these capabilites, Dynatrace helps ensure a successful cloud migration to Microsoft Azure by reducing risk, moving faster and achieving a better business outcome for our cloud migration projects.
