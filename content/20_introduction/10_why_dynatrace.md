## Enterprise Cloud is underpinning our digital transformation

At easyTravel, enterprise cloud brings a great deal of change for it is all:

* completely software driven (including the infrastructure).
* dynamic and built on a complex ecosystem of micro services and containers
* running at massive scale spanning across multiple cloud environments and data centers
* constantly changing at a pace faster than ever before.

All of this is madness is necessary because the expectations of our users is higher than ever. And we, the IT professionals at easyTravel, need to deliver a perfect user experience. Every time.

These factors drove us to completely rethink and revaluate our strategy for monitoring and observability and we must:

* have visibility into what exists and what needs to be moved
* ensure that migration goes according to the plan
* run our applications smoothly post migration

## Why Dynatrace

Dynatrace’s an all-in-one platform with AI at the core delivers the best in class APM, infrastructure monitoring, digital experience management, and digital business analytics with AIOps built in. Dynatrace OneAgent auto-discovers what’s in our environment, it sees how everything interacts so it can build connective tissue that is the Smartscape dependency map.

Knowing that [Gartner has ranked Dynatrace as a leader in their magic quadrant](https://www.dynatrace.com/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-application-performance-monitoring/) for Application Performance Monitoring for the 10th consecutive time gives us confidence that we have picked the right partner. In particular, advanced obserability, Davis AI engine, and complete automation all support our new strategy.

## Advanced observability

What we gain is advanced observability across cloud and hybrid environments, from microservices to mainframe. Automatic full-stack instrumentation, dependency mapping and AI-assisted answers detailing the precise root-cause of anomalies, eliminating redundant manual work, and letting you focus on what matters, delivering instant answers across the full stack.

Dynatrace isn’t just 3 separate pillars. It auto-discovers what’s in our environment, it sees how everything interacts so it can build the connective tissue that is the SmartScape dependency map. When you layer in the digital user experience and the Davis AI-assistant, you have a complete, highly automated, advanced observability platform.
