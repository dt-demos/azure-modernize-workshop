{{% notice warning %}}
The next set of steps assume that your Dynatrace tenant is fully provisioned and you are logged in. 
{{% /notice  %}}

Gather environment and token info To configure and deploy easyTravel and for exercises later in the workshop, we will need the following info from your Dynatrace environment

* Base URL
* Environment ID
* API token
* PaaS token

And we will need the following from your Azure subscription:

* Subscription ID


For this, have provided a simple UNIX shell script for this workshop that prompts for these values and writes them to a file called `creds.json`. Later in the workshop steps, there are a few other simple UNIX shell that will automate the step that read this file so that you donâ€™t need to type or copy-paste these values over and over agaan during the workshop.

So start by running this script that will provide prompts. Follow the sections below to get these values and paste them against the prompt. If you mess up, you can re-run the script.

1 . Capture Dynatrace environment and token info

```
cd ~/modernize-workshop-setup/azure
./inputAzureWorkshopCredentials.sh
```

2 . Login into Dynatrace

### Verify

Your completed data entry, should look like this.

```
Please confirm all are correct:

Dynatrace Base URL       : https://MY-ENVIONMENT.live.dynatrace.com
Dynatrace Environment ID : MY-ENVIONMENT
Dynatrace PaaS Token     : MY-PAAS-TOKEN
Dynatrace API Token      : MY-API-TOKEN
Azure Subscription ID    : xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx
Is this correct? (y/n): y
```

After you confirm, the script will show the saved values in the `creds.json` file. You can view again by simply typing cat `creds.json`. NOTE that the Azure Location and Azure Resource Group are pre-configured.

If you mess up, you can re-run the script again and will prompt you again for each value.

```
cd ~/modernize-workshop-setup/azure
/inputAzureWorkshopCredentials.sh
```
