The easyTravel applicaiton has a feature to enable & disable problem patterns built into its codebase so that we can simulate problems.

To enable a problem that Davis will pickup on **workshop-ez-1**, just run these scripts in the Azure cloud shell that will find the IP address for your **workshop-ez-1** instance and make the required HTTP REST call for the feature flag.

{{% notice info %}}
Best to run each problem pattern seperately so that it is easier to analyze. It will take about 4-5 minutes for the problem pattern to manifest.
