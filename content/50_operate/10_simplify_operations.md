Migrating to the cloud means there are more moving pieces to monitor and manage. As we have learned, Dynatrace fully automates monitoring through OneAgent and the native integration with Azure.

Post-migration, Dynatrace’s deterministic AI engine, DAVIS, helps you run your applications smoothly, pinpointing production issues with root-cause information right at your fingertips. DAVIS leverages Smartscape dependency data, as well as the high-fidelity monitoring data from OneAgent. The AI can be fed with external events such as deployment or configuration change events from your CI/CD or deployment automation tools.

DAVIS’ unique capabilities for automated root cause detection can be integrated with ChatOps, VoiceOps, or auto-remediation actions. This brings your operation teams closer to what we call Autonomous Operations and enables business teams to make better decisions based on monitoring data by using voice or chat commands.
